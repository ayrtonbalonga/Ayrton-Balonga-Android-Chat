Good Day

in order tp run this project properly you need to run the Server file that is in the folder name "Server"

by opening the command line in your system. go to the directory of inside the folder name "Server"

once you are inside the folder then you can type this command  "node Server.js" then press enter

then it will show, that the server is running locally on your machine on port 3000

You can launch the application using visual studio by loading the project files that are in the folder name "Android Chat App"

then once the application open on the virtual device then you can insert your name and press enter then you are going to access the app

and be able to send message, back and forth is you open the application on another virtual android device

Thank You
